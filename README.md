# Massachusetts General Hospital Dashboard

## Project Overview
For the Maven Hospital Challenge, I played the role of an Analytics Consultant for Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The objective was to build a high-level KPI report for the executive team, based on a subset of patient records. The purpose of the report is to give stakeholders visibility into the hospital’s recent performance and answer the following questions:

- How many patients have been admitted or readmitted over time?
- How long are patients staying in the hospital, on average?
- How much is the average cost per visit?
- How many procedures are covered by insurance?

The dashboard was developed using Power BI and is designed to scale to accommodate new data over time.

## About The Data Set
The dataset consists of synthetic data on approximately 1,000 patients of Massachusetts General Hospital from 2011-2022. It includes information on patient demographics, insurance coverage, and medical encounters & procedures.

- **Number of Records:** 75,592
- **Number of Fields:** 55

## Key Metrics
The dashboard provides insights into the following key metrics:
- 📈 Admissions and readmissions trends
- ⏳ Average patient stay duration
- 💰 Average cost per visit
